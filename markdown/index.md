This is a collection of notes I've taken on programming.  
Within a note, entries are dated and prefaced with a list of tags: `(tag1, tag2, ...)`.  
The notes are available as a github repo [here](https://github.com/lzell)  
If you find these notes useful, please consider following my current project, designsystemcompiler.
